**Unit 2: Operations Strategy** <span id="2"></span> 
*The most significant aspect of operations management is the process
itself.  How does Apple take a pile of chips, glass, and plastic, and
turn it into an iPhone?  Their manufacturer in China is responsible for
this process, but Apple is involved every step of the way in order to
ensure quality, reliability, and consistency.  Process flow structures
are the different methods of production deemed appropriate for various
manufacturing contexts.  Does it make sense for Apple to wait for 1
million orders, then make and ship them?  Or should they instead produce
iPhones based on current demand and try to balance inventory?  These are
decisions that the COO must make as each process flow has various costs
associated with it.*  
  
 *Additionally, not every operations department is producing a good we
can consume.  Wall Street traders receive orders from clients and must
execute trades on open markets.  The order itself may pass through
dozens of people before confirmation of the trade is sent back to the
client.  If you consider that “actual trade” to be the product, you can
design an operations process around the goal of executing the trade. 
The result is a process remarkably similar to production.  In this unit,
you will learn how operations managers use long-term, strategic planning
to manage internal and external influences on the organization’s
resource base.*

    Activity and Grading Rubric"**

    and Grading
    Rubric](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/BUS300-Unit-2-Activity-FINAL.pdf)"
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions**:** For this activity, you will write a 2-3 page
    paper on the development of an operation management plan that
    focuses on your business concept that you developed for the Unit 1
    Activity.   A minimum of four scholarly resources should be used in
    order to support your plan, citing your sources in APA format.  Make
    sure to include a References section that also lists the sources
    used in APA format.  As you write your paper, you should address the
    following questions and topics:1. Purchasing
    procedures**: **Identify the necessary input (raw materials
    necessary to generate the output, or product). Who will or can you
    buy the raw materials from?  If you are providing a service, what
    supplies will you need to begin and where will they be purchased
    from?  
      
     2. What accounting and/or purchasing system(s) will you need to
    accomplish buying either a product line or a service-based
    business?   
      
     3. Quality control procedures: Identify what quality control
    measures you will use in order to make sure the product or service
    meets consumer standards.   
     For example, if your business concept was to open a bed and
    breakfast, to answer question 1, you will want to estimate how many
    rooms you will need; how many guests [on average] you intend to
    host; and where you will obtain your groceries, paper items, soap,
    and other guest necessities?  Will you shop at a grocery store, use
    a shopping club like Costco or Sam’s Club, or obtain your inputs
    through some other means?  
        
     Question 2 would include a review of accounting software or systems
    such as: Sage Peachtree Accounting, Quickbook or Netsuite
    Financials (or another you may feel comfortable with).  Identify why
    you chose this system or software for your particular business in
    order to justify its applicability.  
        
     Question  3 would need a similar discussion as you identify your
    quality assurance/control measures that you intend to use to help
    minimize defects or errors as you produce a product or provide a
    service.  Your review of quality control measures will include a
    discussion such as:  Will there be a quality control manager named
    for your business?  Why, or why not?  Will your business use Six
    Sigma processes in its operation?  Why, or why not?  Is there a need
    to utilize ISO 9000 quality standards? Why, or why not?  
        
     Be specific in your essay. It may be helpful to “brainstorm your
    needs” on a separate sheet of paper and once done, create an outline
    for this section (numbers 1, 2, and 3), using topical
    headings.  Then, note how you will address each requirement of these
    sections with specific content.   
        
     Please score your paper or have a friend score your paper using the
    "rubric," or "scoring guide" on the following page. The levels will
    equate to the following letter grades:  
     4 = A; 3 = B; 2 = C; 1 = D; and 0 = F.
