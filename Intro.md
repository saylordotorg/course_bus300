Course Syllabus for "BUS300: Operations Management"
---------------------------------------------------

Operations management is a science with which we are all, in some
capacity, familiar.  We all have scarce resources and have to allocate
those resources properly.  Think about the process of preparing a meal:
you have to gather all the proper ingredients and prepare them for
cooking.  Certain ingredients go in at certain times.  Occasionally, you
fall behind or get too far ahead, jeopardizing the entire meal.  And, of
course, if you find that you do not have enough ingredients, even more
problems arise.  All of these elements of meal preparation - purchasing
ingredients, prepping the ingredients by dicing them up, mixing
ingredients together, boiling or baking the dish, serving, and
cleaning - can be seen as parts of operations management. In the realm
of business, operations management is more complicated than preparing a
family meal.  There may be hundreds or thousands of participants rather
than just you and your brother or wife or grandfather cooking in the
kitchen.  Each participant has a specific role in the operations
process; if any step of the process is disrupted, the whole process can
stall or fall apart.  Smart operations managers will have contingency
plans in the event that stoppages occur. In this course, you will learn
the fundamentals of operations management as they apply to both
production and service-based operations.  Successful completion of this
course will empower you to implement the concepts you have learned in
your place of business.  Even if you do not plan to work in operations,
every department of every company has processes that must be completed;
someone savvy with operations management will be able to improve just
about any process.

### Course Information

Welcome to BUS300.  Below, please find some general information on the
course and its requirements.  
  
 **Course Designer:**

**Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   iTunes U: The Open University’s [“Business Operations
    Lectures](http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/business-operations-for-ipod/id380224811)[”](http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/business-operations-for-ipod/id380224811)
-   Bookboon.com: Albert Porter’s [“Operations
    Management](http://bookboon.com/uk/textbooks/management-organisation/operations-management)[”](http://bookboon.com/uk/textbooks/management-organisation/operations-management)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all its assigned materials.  Pay
special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in later
units.  You will also need to complete:

-   Sub-subunit 4.1.4 Assessment
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assessment listed above and the resources in each unit.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.

Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete it.  If
you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
approximately **103 hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time
advisory” that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit. These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may
be useful to take a look at these time advisories and to determine how
much time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and
then to set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 8
hours. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete the introductory reading (about 1 hour) and half of subunit 1.1
(about 1.5 hours) on Monday night; the remainder of subunit 1.1 and
subunit 1.2 (about 2.5 hours) on Tuesday; subunit 1.3 and subunit 1.4 (a
total of 3 hours) on Wednesday; etc.

**Tips/Suggestions:** As you work through the readings, web media, and
lectures for this course, make sure to take notes on what you learn from
each resource.  These notes will be useful as you study for your Final
Exam.
