**Unit 3: Product Design and Process Selection** <span id="3"></span> 
*If you have purchased a mobile phone recently, you have witnessed a
product category with perhaps the most diverse range of product designs
in the marketplace.  The variety can be mind-boggling.  Looking back a
year or two, you can probably recall a design that looked very
promising, but simply faded away from the shelves after a few months. 
Have you ever wondered what happened to those short-lived products?*  
  
 *Businesses want to design the products that consumers demand.  A good
marketing department can tell the organization what consumers want, and
even convince consumers that they want it.  A company with the most
wonderful product concept cannot be successful unless it also can devise
a process to profitably manufacturer the product.  In this unit, we will
consider the steps involved in designing a product with the
manufacturing process in mind.  We will look at several models that
businesses can use to select the best design process or analyze an
existing process.*
