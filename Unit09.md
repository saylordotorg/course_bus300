**Unit 9: Applications of Project Management** <span id="9"></span> 
*Like quality management, project management is closely tied to the
general operations of a firm.  The difference is that project management
focuses on the future, whereas operations and quality focus on the
present.  Project management usually involves addressing a specific
project within a specific time frame.  Regardless of whether the project
involves installing a computer system or building a skyscraper, the
project manager must evaluate the costs versus benefits, plan manageable
steps, and monitor progress to successfully complete the project.  In
addition to studying the activities in the project management process,
we will examine how project managers perform network analysis to
understand the activities and milestones in a project.*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 6.5 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 9.1: 4 hours

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

-   Explain each of the elements in the Project Management process.
-   Construct a network diagram to illustrate the relationship between
    project activities.
-   Compare and contract CPM and PERT models of network analysis.
-   Use a Gantt chart to compare project progress to planned progress.

    Forecasting](http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/using-excel-for-forecasting/id288699098?i=91220249)”
    (iTunes U)  
        
     Instructions: Watch Dr. Jerz’s 2-lecture video series on
    forecasting.  The “Forecasting” lecture discusses the steps in the
    forecasting process as well as several forecasting models.  The
    second lecture will show you how Dr. Jerz has used Microsoft Excel
    to automate forecasting processes. The combined length of both
    videos is 37 minutes. When you open the above links, you will need
    to select the “View in iTunes” link next to each title to download
    the iTunesU content.  Forecasting is a vital part of operations
    management in that the manufacturer has to know what order
    quantities to purchase to produce an adequate supply that meets
    consumer demand. Forecasting is used to determine what quantities
    consumers are likely to purchase and to provide suppliers who work
    with manufacturers with inputs, so the manufacturer can generate
    sufficient outputs.
