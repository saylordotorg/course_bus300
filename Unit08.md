**Unit 8: Work Systems Design** <span id="8"></span> 
*It seems reasonable that a worker’s level of job satisfaction would
influence his or her job performance.  At some point in your life, you
have probably performed a job task that you did not enjoy.  Perhaps the
work was too physically demanding or there was a problem with the
location of the work area.  Or perhaps the work was so monotonous that
you were starved for mental stimulation.  One of the ways that
operations managers can impact job satisfaction is through work systems
design.  In this unit, we will explore how operations managers use
strategies like skill variety, task significance, or work organization
to enhance job performance.  We will also consider models for analyzing
work to eliminate unnecessary tasks and regulate the duration of each
stage in a production line.  *
