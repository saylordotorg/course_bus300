**Unit 10: Inventory** <span id="10"></span> 
*In a manufacturing context, inventory includes raw materials, work that
is in process, and finished goods.  Running out of a necessary component
in the middle of production can be very costly for a manufacturer.  The
goal of inventory management is to balance the cost of ordering and
storing material with the cost of not having that material available
when it is needed.  Effective inventory management combines elements of
accounting, sales, and operations management.  Certain aspects of this
unit will feel like a review of accounting, but we will be discussing
accounting from the perspective of the operation manager.  There are a
number of strategies for managing inventory.  Because direct costs can
be calculated based on the length of time an inventory is in storage,
accountants and operations managers try to prevent inventory from
“sitting around.”*  
  
 *An example of one of the most successful implementers of inventory
management is Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart uses vendor-managed inventory, meaning
that its merchandise does not sit in a Wal-Mart warehouse.  Instead, it
stays with the manufacturer until Wal-Mart learns from its stores that
more is needed.  This keeps Wal-Mart from having to pay to store all of
the products it sells.  In this unit, we will consider how demand
influences the operations manager’s choice of inventory management
system.  We will also examine models for determining how much inventory
to order and when to order it.  *
