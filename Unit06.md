**Unit 6: Just-In-Time and Lean Systems** <span id="6"></span> 
*Would you order a delivery pizza for dinner from a restaurant
advertising delivery in 6 hours?  How about a restaurant that can bring
you a cold, stale pizza in only 5-minutes?  To meet the consumer’s
needs, the pizza shop must be able to give customers the number of
pizzas they want when they want it.  Preparing pizzas in advance is too
wasteful because most con,sumers are not likely to buy a stale pizza. 
Meanwhile, if you take too long to deliver the pizza, you will lose
customers to a more responsive competitor.  The concept of just-in-time
focuses on making what you need to meet customer demand only when you
need it.  For a pizza delivery shop, that probably means a fresh pizza
at the customer’s door in around 30 minutes.  This philosophy can apply
to a range of operations, from simply washing a car to manufacturing a
complex aircraft.*  
  
 *Similarly, the concept of lean manufacturing refers to eliminating
waste in the manufacturing process.  The Toyota Product System is the
model for modern manufacturers that want to control waste.  In this
unit, we will look at seven types of waste and processes for controlling
them.  In addition, we will explore the origins of the “Just-in-Time”
(JIT) philosophy and the use of pull systems to control inventory.*
