**Unit 5: Supply Chain Management (SCM)** <span id="5"></span> 
*Many of the problems associated with supply chain management are
closely related to the typical problems of operations management. 
Instead of the question: “How should we make this?”, it becomes: “How
should we get this from point A to B?”  It may be best to ship the
product straight from the factory to the customer, but it may be
prohibitively expensive to do so.  Many firms find it easier and cheaper
to ship products to distribution warehouses first and distribute to
customers on a more local level. *  
  
 *Supply chain management refers to the entire process of obtaining the
raw goods from a supplier, converting those goods into products,
shipping products, and placing them in front of customers.  Operations
management typically focuses on the production side of supply chain
management, but a good manager is concerned with the entire process.  In
this unit, we will look at the management of firm resources on the
supply side as well as the distribution of finished goods to the
consumer.*
