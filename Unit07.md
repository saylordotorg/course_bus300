**Unit 7: Capacity Planning and Facility Layout** <span id="7"></span> 
*In the last unit, we looked at manufacturing and service processes that
help companies deliver what a customer wants when they want it.  Before
the firm can successfully institute these processes, it must understand
the requirements that determine its production capacity.  In the
introduction to Unit 6, we considered how a pizza shop delivers its
product.  Is it likely that their 30-minute delivery would cover an
order for 100 pizzas?  Probably not, because they have planned their
production capacity based on the demand of individual or family-sized
consumers.  When planning production capacity, the firm has to consider
not only demand, but also the physical aspects of their facility.  How
close does the operation need to be to consumers?  Is the facility
within easy reach of the resources needed for production?*  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn how to use forecasting models to
understand capacity requirements.  We will also evaluate factors that
help managers identify the optimal location for a new facility. 
Finally, we will conclude with a review of basic facility layout designs
that maximize production efficiency. *
