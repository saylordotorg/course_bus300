**Unit 1: Operations Management Overview** <span id="1"></span> 
*Operations management is a vast topic but can be bundled into a few
distinct categories, each of which will be covered in later units.  (It
should be noted, however, that entire courses could be devoted to each
of these topics individually.)  Because most people do not work in a
formal operations department, we will begin with an overview of
operations management itself.  The top manager of an operations
department is usually called the Director of Operations.  Most
operations departments will report to a Chief Operating Officer (COO),
who reports to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  The COO is often
considered the most important figure in a firm, next to the CEO.*  
  
 *The history of operations management can be traced back to the
industrial revolution, when production began to shift from small, local
companies to large-scale production firms.  One of the most significant
contributions to operations management came in the early 20th century,
when Henry Ford pioneered the assembly line manufacturing process.  This
process drastically improved productivity and made automobiles
affordable to the masses.  Understanding the motivations behind
innovations of the past can help us identify factors that may motivate
individuals in the future of operations management.*

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: For this activity, you will apply the concepts of
    operations management to real world situations. You will use this
    unit to begin developing an operation management plan by writing a
    2-3 page paper on a business concept of your choosing. You may wish
    to develop a business such as a retail sales operation, an online
    service like tutoring, or maybe a personal service such as lawn care
    or pet grooming as your business. Use the information from Unit 1 to
    help you identify what aspects are to be covered and explain, in
    detail, why you made certain choices. In writing your paper, you
    should research and consider at least 4 scholarly sources (i.e.
    textbooks, scholarly articles from a peer reviewed journal, etc.) As
    you write the paper, make sure to address the following topics:  

    -   Will the company be business-to-consumer or
        business-to-business?
    -   Will the business manufacture a product, deliver a service,
        broker information, offer goods for sale, or distribute goods
        for others?
    -   Will the business offer one product or service, or a range of
        products and services?
    -   Will the company have a bricks-and-mortar presence, or sell
        strictly over the Web?
    -   Will the firm be a large company, a medium-sized enterprise, or
        a small business?
    -   How will you provide /transport the service or product to the
        consumer?
    -   Will there be a need for inventory storage?

      
     Please score your paper or have a friend score your paper using the
    following "rubric," or "scoring guide." The levels will equate to
    the following letter grades:  
     4 = A; 3 = B; 2 = C; 1 = D; and 0 = F.
