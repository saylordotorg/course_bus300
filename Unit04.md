**Unit 4: Quality Management** <span id="4"></span> 
*Quality management is a primary concern in operations departments. 
Though all employees and managers should be concerned with maintaining
quality, most firms host a team dedicated to ensuring the quality of
production.  Quality management can come in any number of different
forms.  Quality control usually involves the random sampling of products
coming off the line (with the goal of ensuring that all products are up
to standards).  This may be for compliance reasons (such as in meat
production) or for quality service (such as checking the seams in the
leather of a Rolls Royce car).  Other quality managers are concerned
with the quality of the production process itself: are all employees
being productive?  Is there a bottleneck in the production process? 
These focuses on efficiency are especially important for products with
low margins.  In this unit, you will learn about a few of the pioneers
in total quality management as well as the processes used to control
quality in manufacturing and service organizations.*
